# Regular Expressions

> <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Regexp.html" target="_blank">Ruby Regexp</a>

Regular expressions (**regex** or **regexps**) are patterns which describe the contents of a string. Theyâ€™re used for testing whether a string contains a given pattern or for extracting the portions that match. Common examples of regexps are "find-and-replace" operations and string format validation (i.e. phone numbers or email addresses).

Many programming languages have regexp capabilities built-in, including JavaScript and Ruby. Luckily, regex pattern syntax is fairly consistent across languages. Today we'll use regexps to match string patterns in Ruby.

## Defining and Matching

Regexps are bounded by forward-slashes (`/`). **For example:**

```ruby
/hello/   
```

To test if a string matches the pattern of a regexp, we use `.match`. **For example:**

```ruby
# returns match data if any
/san/.match("san francisco") #=> #<MatchData "san">

# returns nil if no match data
/san/.match("San Francisco") #=> nil
```

## Basic Regexp Patterns

For a more complete list of basic regex patterns, see <a href="http://rubular.com" target="_blank">Rubular's Regex quick reference</a>.

```ruby
/[abc]/ # matches a single character from the set: 'a', 'b', or 'c'

/\A/ # matches start of string

/\s/ # matches any whitespace character

/\d/ # matches any digit (number)

/(a|b)/ # matches 'a' or 'b'
```

## Challenges

Use <a href="http://rubular.com" target="_blank">Rubular</a> for all challenges *except* Base Challenge #1.

### Base Challenges
1. In the terminal, type `irb` (you're now in the ruby console!). Type `/hello world/.class`. What does it return? Note: To exit `irb` in the terminal, simply type `exit`.

2. Write a regexp to match instances of "regex" in the text below. Copy and paste the text (including the HTML tags!) into Rubular as the test string.

  ```html
  <p>A Regular Expression (regex or regexp for short) is a special text string for describing a search pattern.
  You can think of regular expressions as <span>wildcards</span> on steroids. You are probably familiar with wildcard
  notations such as *.txt to find all text files in a file manager. The regex equivalent is <span>\.txt\</span></p>
  ```

3. With the same test string (text above), write a regexp to match instances of "regex", "regexp", or "regular expression".

4. Edit the regexp you just wrote to make sure it's case-insensitive (i.e. it should match "Regular Expression" as well as "regular expression"). **Hint:** Look up `/i`.

### Stretch Challenges

You're encouraged to look up external information for these challenges, but not to look for pre-written regex patterns that solve the challenges (you would have no trouble finding them!).  Instead, logically break down the string patterns, search for the individual regex ingredients your logic requires, and put them together.

1. Again using the same paragraph from above, write a regexp to match HTML tags (like the `<p></p>` and `<span></span>` above). **Hint:** Inside the regex, you must "escape" all forward-slashes (`/`) with a back-slash (`\`), like this: `\/`.  

2. Write a regexp to validate a phone number. Think about the following formats:  
  * `(555) 555-5555`
  * `555-555-5555`
   
   **Hint:** The regex interpreter knows not to interpret escaped characters as regex symbols, so remember to escape characters like '[', ']', '(', ')', and '?'.

3. Write a regexp to validate an email address. You can assume the format `test123@example.com`.
