# WDI 22 Week 5 Weekend Homework
​

## Congratulations!  

#### At this point, you've completed your first full  stack web development project! We'd like you to practice one more aspect of GitHub over the weekend and create an issue on your Project 1 repository.

#### Starting next week, we'll learn a new programming language: [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)!  And, in this next unit, we'll use new tools for our server Ruby on Rails and database PostgreSQL. Don't worry about studying all of that this weekend. To help get prepped for Monday, you'll do a few Ruby tutorials and exercises, and some reading. But first, let's take one more look at our Project 1. 
​

## Project 1 Issues
​
*Time: 15 minutes*

​
You had just over a week to work on Project 1, and no one got done everything they thought of! 
​
Some time this weekend, follow [GitHub's instructions to create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue) on your Project 1 repository. Your issue should include what you want your site/code to do, what it currently does, and things you tried or ideas you had to get it working the way you want.

We will be working together Monday morning on some of these issues! 
​

## Ruby!
​

#### Enough with Project 1, on to Ruby! 

1. Get as far as you can in each of the following three tutorials. You can do this in your terminal using irb (ruby's version of the node console) by simply typing 'irb' in your terminal window. You can also work on these using '.rb' files. To do this, save a file like 'tryruby.rb' and to run it, from the same directory, type 

     ``` ruby tryruby.rb ```

    - [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0) levels 1-4 - an interactive introduction to Ruby. *Time: 30 minutes*

   - [Intro to Ruby Data-Types](ruby-data-types.md)

   - [Intro to Ruby arrays, hashes, and blocks](arrays-hashes-blocks.md)

2. Take about fifteen minutes (total) skimming through the following 3 free books on Ruby. Spend a little time really reading the table of contents (if there is one) and seeing what piques your interest. 

 - http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html
 - http://humblelittlerubybook.com/book/html/index.html
 - http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/

3. Choose at least one of these books to read more of. I recommend you choose one to spend as much time as you can with this weekend. (But also get some rest, it's been a long week!) 

     **reading tips for technical books:**
  - If you are getting bored, skip ahead to something you are more curios about. You can always come back later.
  - Read the about the author, so you know why you should care what they think. After that, skip to chapter 1, or alternatively skip to a chapter you are especially excited about. Don't bother with the introduction, etc. 
  
4. Completely Optional Reading: Practical Object Oriented Design (POODR) by Sandi Metz chapters 1-3. (This is not a free book, so it is optional. Highly reccomended reading however.)

### There is nothing to submit for homework!

### Have a great weekend and be safe!
